## Our Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to introduce you to the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps youâ€™ll build in the future. This app will teach you how to make apps with functionality using setState() inside Stateful Flutter widgets. This project is only for practical foundation for advance projects.


## What you will create
This can make the die roll at the press of a button. With this app in your pocket, youâ€™ll be able to settle any score on the go!
